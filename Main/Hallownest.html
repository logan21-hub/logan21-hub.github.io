            <h1>A Wyrm Reborn</h1>
            <p>At some point in history, a giant Wyrm arrived in Hallownest and decided to settle there. Wyrms are a great and ancient species, gifted with the ability of foresight. Based on clues from the game, it appears that this Wyrm was the last of it's kind. Once it settled, it promptly perished. From within the molted corpse, there was an egg that hatched into a new being, the Pale King. The Pale King was a higher being, a life-form that rises above all others. He was said to shine with a pale light, and whose goal was to lord over the bugs of the land and rule. And so, he began to build his Kingdom of Hallownest.</p>
            <p>His first task was to bring the existing tribes of the land into his Kingdom's embrace. The Mushroom tribe of the Fungal Wastes had a hivemind, that welcomed the protection of the Pale King, and believed his gift of foresight would be a boon to them. The Mantis Tribe that also resided there, were less cooperative. They had a long and rich history and culture, and they were fiercely territiorial. They did not care for the pale King and his kingdom, but they did agree to a truce. In exchange for autonomy, they would gaurd the entrance to Deepnest, and prevent the beasts of that land from invading.  </p>
