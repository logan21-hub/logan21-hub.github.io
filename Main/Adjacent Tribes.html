                <h2>Mantis Tribe</h2>
                <p>The Mantis Tribe is a proud group of bugs who prize strength and combat prowess above all else.Thier fierce fighting style and strong will made them an extremely independent faction, who forged a tentative alliance with the Pale King that still let them retain autonomy. They are one of the few groups in Hallownest that were able to avoid falling to the Infection.Their village is located in the Fungal Wastes, and was originally ruled by four Mantis Lords</p>

                <h2>Mosskin</h2>
                <p>The mosskin are a race of bugs born from the dream of a higher being called Unn. They are her followers, and reside in the area of the kingdom known as Greenpath. They were a fairly developed society, with temples and soldiers. Even after the arrival of the Pale King, the Law of Unn remained, however, the mosskin still peacefully coexisted with the Kingdom of Hallownest. </p>

                <h2>Mushroom Tribe</h2>
                <p>The Mushrooms are a race of fungi that share a sentient hivemind, and reside in the Fungal Wastes. They were very receptive to the arrival of the Pale King, and viewed his foresight as a strength. Thus, they readily allowed themselves to be annexed by Hallownest, and welcome its protection.</p>

                <p>The Hive is a group of warrior bees led by their queen, Vespa. The Hive did not want anything to do with the pale King and his rule, and so they sealed off the Hive from the rest of the kingdom, with only patrol scouts being allowed to come and go.</p>

                <p>The Moth Tribe is an ancient group, that is known for their pacifism. They were born from a higher being known as the Radiance. Once they served and worshipped the Radiance, but after they became part of Hallownest, they turned their backs on it, and worshipped the Pale King instead. In present day, the only moth settlement is in the Resting Grounds, but they could have had a settlement atop Crystal Peak as well.</p>
